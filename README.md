In this study we try to explore the possibility of classifying an individualâ€™s geographical origin based on their personality traits. We aim to understand the correlation between personality characteristics and nationality. To achieve this, we have experimented with several machine learning algorithms including SVM, Naive Bayes, xGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting amongst others.
